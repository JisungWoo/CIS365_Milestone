# CIS365_Milestone

This is repository for my CIS 365 - Business Database Systems - semester long milestone (2019)


For this project, my team and I were given an imaginary client and their request to work on for a semester. 
We had to construct conceptual data models and translate to logical designs using the relational model.
We had to create EERD diagrams before using SQL and inserting them into the database.
We also used standard SQL and complex scripts to construct databases.
We used the databases we constructed to answer business questions given in class
